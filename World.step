##
## ADDING NEW OBJECTS
## To add a new object, choose an internal name for it, generally a short string like "campaign" or "box1".
## Then add a method of the form:
##   Type internal_name type.
## where type is whatever kind of object it is (room, thing, door, cat) or any other type defined using KindOf.
##
## Then write a Description method for it.  This will get printed when the player examines it.  You generally want it to be more interesting
## than just the type name of it.
##   Description internal_name: some sentences describing it in detail...
##
## Then you generally want to write a DescriptivePhrase method for it:
##   DescriptivePhrase internal_name: some noun-phrase describing it
## If you don't include a DescriptivePhrase method, it will just say "a type", which is kind of boring.
##
## If the object isn't a room or door, you'll want to specify where it is:
##   Location internal_name room_or_container.
##
## Rooms aren't contained in other containers, although regions (room containers) will be supported at some point.
## Doors are in two places at once, so you don't use Location methods, you use a Connects method:
##   Connects internal_name_of_the_door room1 room2.
## 
## Now add any other declarations you want to add to specify the details of the object, e.g.
## Open, Closed, SwitchedOn, etc.
##
## Finally, if you want to customize the behavior of actions for this object, add InsteadOf, Before, After,
## or Failure methods for those actions to override its usual behavior.
##

##
## OBJECTS THAT BEHAVIOR AUTONOMOUSLY
## To make an object do something on it's own, make it an instance of the agent type.  People and animals
## are already instances of agent, but if you're using your own kind of type that isn't a subtype of those,
## then just add:
##    KindOf myType agent.
## Or for a one-off of an object that doesn't have a special type, just add an extra Type method for it.
##
## Now define a Tick method for it:
##    Tick internal_name: stuff to do after every command...
## If you want it to run actions from Actions.step, you can do that by saying [Do [action args...]].
